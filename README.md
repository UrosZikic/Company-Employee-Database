# Company-Employee-Database
This is a simple app built for an imaginary company database (built with vanilla JS)

This is a CRUD application where data can be written, read, updated and deleted.

Each table data can be edited individually. A click will open the prompt window which serves as the editing environment.
To delete the table row, simply open the prompt and type in "delete", this command will remove the specified field.
